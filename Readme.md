and increase convenience to book the sport facility and equipment. They just choose
the required available time slot by clicking a few buttons then to complete the
booking process.

distribution of the resources is balanced, in some un-preferable cases,the bookings will get
restricted also with a proper notification The admins are the coordinators and supervisors with
varying levels of control. They will coordinate the whole application . Like from the login into
system to creating new booking entries and updating them .The coordinators accept the feedback
regarding the application and pass it on to the supervisors who can resolve the issues.
5.Five sub modules are there for 4 different sports and one for previous history and
bookings check.

the application.

## Problem Description
Very Often, sports venues have such problems as places idled, venues are filled at the high
time of movement, which greatly affects the practical efficiency of sports venues resources
and increases the management burden to venues.
Moreover, during any mega sports events the facilities are limited to some extent, resulting
in a lot of chaos in event organization and management. Therefore, with the rapid
development of information technology, college sports venues are realizing the need of a
new online booking trend.

2.The Sport facility booking application enables students and staff to save their time and increase convenience to book the sport facility and equipment. They just choose the required available time slot by clicking a few buttons then to complete the booking process.
3. To develop a viewable time slot to display status of the sport facility or equipment.
4. It provides the better utilization of sports resources .Though the distribution of the resources is balanced, in some un-preferable cases,the bookings will get restricted also with a proper notification


##  User Requirements

3.The user should be able to check out the resources distributions based on a particular category.
